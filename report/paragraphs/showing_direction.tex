The main motivation of this prototype design was to show the visual output only on the drawer where the search item belongs.
However, we noticed that we can use other LEDs from other drawers to visualise the direction of the drawer which consists search items. 
This idea is really helpful when the shelf is very big and we can only see a portion of the shelf if we stand closer to it.
