\subsection{Large Scale Production}
We implemented the prototype only for six drawers, but we designed the framework in such a way that it easily expendable to hundred of drawers. 
Due to the limitation of numbers I/O pins in Arduino we have still limitation to extend the number of drawers. 
This problem can easily be solved by mapping output into a multiplexed form in the Arduino and from the shelf side by demultiplexing to decode the multiplexed output into the I/O mapping of the drawers. 

\subsection{Increasing Form Factor}
Currently the shape weight cell consume a lot of space inside the drawer, for example it reduces the overall from factor of a drawer by thirty percent from the original size of that drawer.
Solving this issue fairly a large scale production issue. And this can be solved embedding light weight and thinner shape weight sensor with the drawers.
