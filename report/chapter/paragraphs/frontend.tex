\subsection{Shelf Control System}
The whole concept of smart shelf follows a IoT principle. According to previously mentioned Publish/Subscribe patter the Arduino which is the main controller of the smart shelf is subscribed with some topic in the MQTT broker. The server itself publish topic based with some name so that Arduino can receive the user command from the MQTT broker. After receiving the information Arduino parse the JSON text and invoke command to glow any led based on the server side information. Similarly, The reading from sensor send to the back end in the same way the we receive information from backend, but this time the Web-app act as a subscriber to topics and Arduino publishes on that topics.  The communication tool and hardware used for communicating with server is Ethernet communication which solely operated by the ethernet card Arduino Ethernet Shied.
