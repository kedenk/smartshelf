This paper shows a solution for finding items fast in efficient in a big shelf by combining topics from the domains Internet of Things, Human Computer Interaction, Automation and Ubiquitous computing. 
The proposed solution \textit{Smart Shelf} offers a user interaction in two ways. 
First via a webapp where the user can search for items and get information about them. 
Secondly, the Smart Shelf gives visual feedback using LEDs on the drawers to indicate if a drawer is empty or where the searched item for a user is. 
These solutions enhance the usability of such shelves. 
The system propose functionality to search with multiple users for different items. 
Additionally, a predictive management system is implemented to reduce items out of stock. 
Furthermore, in a evaluation with a user study some drawbacks and advantages are shown. 
These led to different aspects of further work.
